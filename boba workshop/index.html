            <p id="par">
                Hack Club is a global community of high school students who are passionate about coding and technology.
                 Founded by Zach Latta in 2014, the club offers a platform for young programmers to collaborate, learn,
                  and create through hands-on projects and hackathons. The goal is to empower teens with the skills and
                   resources they need to become future leaders in technology and innovation. Whether you're a beginner
                    or an experienced coder, Hack Club provides a supportive environment where you can explore your
                     interests, build projects, and connect with like-minded peers from around the world.
